Description of the Data

This folder contains the health information used for the study on heart disease risk assessment. The data represent records collected from individuals with the aim of understanding how different physical, clinical, and lifestyle factors contribute to the risk of heart-related problems.

The data were collected from a medical professional for academic and research purposes. Each record corresponds to one individual and includes measurements related to age, body characteristics, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and daily habits. The information is complete and does not contain missing entries.

Nature of the Data

The data include details grouped into the following categories:

Personal details such as age and biological sex

Body measurements such as height, weight, and body mass index

Health indicators including cholesterol values and blood pressure readings

Lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption

Derived health measures like pulse pressure

Risk outcomes, which indicate the level of heart disease risk for each individual

Each entry reflects a real-world health profile, making the data suitable for studying patterns related to heart disease risk.

Purpose of Using This Data

The purpose of using this data is to:

Identify important factors that influence heart disease risk

Study relationships between health indicators and risk levels

Compare predicted risk with actual observed risk

Support early identification of individuals who may require medical attention

The data support both numerical risk assessment and category-based risk grouping, helping to understand heart disease risk in a structured and meaningful way.

Ethical Considerations
